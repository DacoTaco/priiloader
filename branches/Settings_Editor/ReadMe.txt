nothing special, just a tool to edit the priiloader settings file. 
currently only supports rev 54 or above (untill i feel the need to change something again in the settings struct :P )

how it works?
place the loader.ini in the same directory as the compiled exe and run the exe

once you are in the main screen keys 0 - 9 will change the settings and esc will exit

when exiting you will be prompted if you want to save the settings back to loader.ini


the perpose? for sneek / dolphin ofc :)
