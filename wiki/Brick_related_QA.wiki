=Brick protection=

Priiloader does not provide as complete protection as Bootmii/boot2, but it's still useful for solving many of the most common bricks, accessing it through the Homebrew Channel or Bootmii/IOS to fix them. It is the best protection that can be installed in consoles that can not install Bootmii/boot2. In theory, the only elements that would impede the functioning of Priiloader if they are deleted or corrupted are:
 * IOS36?
 * Homebrew Channel IOS (usually IOS58)
 * System Menu IOS (usually IOS30, IOS50, IOS60, IOS70 and IOS80)
 * System Menu (in this case even if it is corrupt but it's bootable Priiloader still works, but not if it was deleted)

Therefore, Priiloader is not useful in case of a full brick or black brick where the system menu and / or basic IOS has been erased, corrupted or replaced by stubbed IOS.
