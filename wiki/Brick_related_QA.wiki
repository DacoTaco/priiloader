=Brick protection=

Priiloader does not provide as complete protection as Bootmii/boot2, but it's still useful for solving many of the most common bricks, accessing it through the Homebrew Channel or Bootmii/IOS to fix them. It is the best protection that can be installed in consoles that can not install Bootmii/boot2. In theory, the only elements that would impede the functioning of Priiloader if they are deleted or corrupted are:
 * *System Menu IOS* (see which [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/System_Menu here])
 * *System Menu title* (in this case even if it is corrupt but it's bootable Priiloader still works, but not if it was deleted)
 * *Homebrew Channel IOS* (IOS58)
 * *IOS36* (for older apps)

Therefore, Priiloader is not useful in case of a full brick or black brick where the system menu and / or basic IOS have been erased, corrupted or replaced by stubbed IOS.
