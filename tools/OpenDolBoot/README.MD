# What is OpenDolBoot #
OpenDolBoot is a tool that injects nand booting code into a .dol binary making them a full bootable .app
these .app files can be used in custom titles/channels or used to replace title binaries. 

On The Wii these are fully function, and the tool is used by Priiloader to make itself bootable at system menu start
On vWii these **ONLY work with channels**. you can **NOT** replace ancast image binaries in channels (like system menu) with these but work with all other channels (forwarders, homebrew channel, games, ...)
