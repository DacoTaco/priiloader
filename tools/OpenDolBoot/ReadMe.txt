Open Source version of Dolboot. exists in C# (made by _Dax_) and C ( made by DacoTaco )

for the C# version you need .NET framework 2.0 and the first 16 bytes need to be removed from the nboot.bin


these apps inject your dol with nboot data making them bootable for a system menu booting dol (or system menu replacment)
