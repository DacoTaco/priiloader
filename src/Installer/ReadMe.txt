* Priiloader Installer - An installation utiltiy for priiloader *
---------------------------------------------------------------
==========================
Binary Distribution Notes
==========================

This installer/removal tool will install Priiloader
any previous version and can be installed over the top of an older install. There is also
a removal option that will restore your system menu and clean all traces of Priiloader
from your system.

Usage:

Press (+/A) to install or update Priiloader.
Press (-/Y) to remove Priiloader and restore your system menu.
Press (HOME/Start) to chicken out and quit the installer!

To access Priiloader and configure it please hold (RESET) during the boot cycle.

Requirements:

if run from HBC 1.0.7 and above, no ios patching is needed at all. however, if the installer
has failed to get root access of the nand, then IOS36 needs to be fully patched as the installer
will use that ios instead.

Priiloader itself does not need any ios patching (and we recommend to keep the system menu ios unpatched)


Disclaimer:

This tool comes without any warranties and we accept no liability if you turn your wii into a
paper weight with it. I have tested this tool with 100% success on 23+ WII's. Hopefully you
will have no serious issues with it!

Scam Warning:
that this is a -FREE- tool. if you paid to get this software in any way (during a guide or got a link/media
containing the software after paying) , you have been scammed and you should demand a refund and/or sue the bastard
as this is released under GPL they are most likely not following that rule either (stating they should add the
license to the package and if code was changed add a note what code was changed , like a diff/patch file)
